# Code for a Cause @Staples
## Purpose

We want to bring awareness and change to our community through coding and "hacking". 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

## What we do

We aim to participate in multiple hackathons throughout the year. We will learn the basic hackathon skills and discuss potential social hacking projects during our weekly meet. 

## When and where do we meet

We meet mostly onlne.
